### General Info
***
Sometimes, I just want to hear something good withouth looking for it. I love music but not search it. for that reason I prefer to turn the radio on. I made this tool for myself to get music in one click. 

For the moment, I just added 4 of the radios that I like most:

Capitol
Cosmos
Dance
Rock

Visit it in the next link, enjoy!
